== Red Hat Solutions: IT Optimization - Infrastructure Migration

:numbered:

== Overview

This demonstration uses Red Hat CloudForms as a broker to drive virtual-to-virtual tools such as `ovftool` and `virt-v2v` to migrate VMs from VMware vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization 

.Goal
* Migrate the VMs with a Red Hat Solution: IT Optimization - Infrastructure Migration
+
NOTE: The source VM's are still maintained post migration and are not deleted. This allows for "failback" if a migration failure occurs.

.Prerequisites

* Deployment of the demo environment which includes the following provisioned VMs:
** `jboss0` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `jboss1` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `lb` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running Nginx configured to proxy traffic to `jboss0` and `jboss1`
** `db` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running PostgreSQL that the `jboss0` and `jboss1` application servers connect to

[IMPORTANT]
====
* It takes about 20 ~ 30 minutes for the demo to load completely and become accessible.
** Wait for the full demo to load, even if some of its systems are marked "Up."
* Watch for an email with information about how to access your demo environment.
** Make note of the email's contents: a list of hostnames, IP addresses, and your GUID.
** Whenever you see <YOUR-GUID> in the demo instructions, replace it with the GUID provided in the email.
* You can get real-time updates and status of your demo environment at https://www.opentlc.com/rhpds-status.
====
+
[TIP]
Be mindful of the runtime of your demo environment! It may take several hours to complete the demo, so you may need to extend the runtime. This is especially important in later steps when you are building virtual machines. For information on how to extend runtime and lifetime, see https://www.opentlc.com/lifecycle.

== Getting Started

. Once the system is running, use SSH to access your demo server using your OPENTLC login name and private SSH key.

* Using a Unix/Linux system:
+
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key <YOUR-OpenTLC-USERNAME-redhat.com>@workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

* Example for user 'batman' and GUID '1a2b', using the default ssh private key:
+
----
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa batman-redhat.com@workstation-1a2b.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Become `root` using the provided password:
+
----
$ sudo -i
----

. Check the status of the environment using ansible:
+
----
# ansible all -m ping
----
+
This command establishes a connection to all the machines in the environment (except ESXi servers). 
In case the machines are up an running a success message, per each, will show up. 
This is an example of a success message for the VM jboss0.example.com:
+
----
jboss0.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
----
+ 
There are 4 VMs in the vCenter environment hosting an app with Nginx as loadbalancer, two JBoss EAP in domain mode, and a Postgresql database.
To check only if these ones are running, you may use the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----

. Establish an SSH connection to the CloudForms server and monitor `automation.log`:
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
[TIP]
The log entries are very long, so it helps if you stretch this window as wide as possible.
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudFomrm web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.


. From a web browser, open each of the URLs below in its own window or tab, using these credentials (except when noted):

* *Username*: `admin`
* *Password*: `<to_be_provided>`
+
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.

* *Red Hat Virtualization Manager:* `https://rhevm-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
.. Navigate to and click *Administration Portal* and log in using `admin`, `<to_be_provided>`, and `internal`.

* *vCenter:* `https://vcenter-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`

.. Use `root` as the username to log in to vCenter.

.. Click *Log in to vSphere Web Client*.

** Flash Player is required.
+
[TIP]
Modern browsers have flash player disabled by default. You may need to enable it for this page.

.. Click *VMs and Templates*.

* *CloudForms:* `https://cf-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+
[TIP]
You can also find these URLs in the email provided when you provisioned the demo environment.

=== Validate the Current VMs

. On the CloudForms web interface, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*.

. If you see an exclamation mark (*!*), or a cross (*x*) in a provider, check the provider's box, go to *Authentication -> Re-check Authentication Status*.
+
[TIP]
Take into account that vCenter may take longer to start.

. Go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs*.

. All VMs and Templates in both RHV and vSphere show as entities in CloudForms.
+
[NOTE]
If you needed to validate providers, you may have to wait a few minutes and refresh the screen before the VMs show up.

. Select the pane *VMs & Templates* and, in it, the *VMware* provider.

. Only the VMs and Templates in vSphere will show.

=== Configure Red Hat Virtualization as a Migration Destination

. On the `cf` system, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*.

. Click *RHV*.

. Select *Policy -> Edit Tags*.

. Select *Point of Arrival* and then select *Rhev* for the assigned value.
+
* This sets this provider as an available Red Hat Virtualization destination.

. Select the *provider_type* tag and select *POA* for the assigned value, then click *Save*.
+
* This sets this provider as the current point of arrival.

=== Configure VMware as a Migration Source

. Navigate to the *VMware* provider.

. Select *Policy -> Edit Tags*.

. Select *provider_type* and select *POD* for the assigned value, then click *Save*.
+
* This sets this provider as the point of departure or source provider.

== Migrate the db (PostgreSQL) VM from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization

. Use CloudForms to shut down (_not_ power off) the VMs to be migrated. Initially just `db` but, all VMs can be shut down (`db`, `jboss0`, `jboss1`, `lb`).
+
[TIP]
It can be verified that `db` VM is down by running, in the terminal, in the workstation machine, the check command:
`# ansible db.example.com -m ping`

For all application VMs (`db`, `jboss0`, `jboss1`, `lb`) the check command is:
`# ansible app -m ping`

=== Set VM Migration Attributes

. On the `cf` system, go to *Services -> Catalogs* and select the *Service Catalogs* pane.

. Under *All Services -> Import CSV*, select *Import Attributes*.

. On the right, click *Order*.

. On the resulting screen, select `attribute_db.csv` in the *Filename* field and click *Submit*.

. Monitor `automation.log` on the `cf` server.  When the process is complete, continue with the next section.

It can be done by establishing an SSH connection to the CloudForms server and watching the content of `automation.log`:
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----

+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudFomrm web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.
+
[TIP]
The csv files for attributes can be accessed in the machine `cf` under the folder `/mnt/migrate/import_csv/attributes/`.

=== Set VM Migration Tags

. On the `cf` system, go to *Services -> Catalogs -> Service Catalogs*.

. Under *All Services -> Import CSV*, select *Import Tags*.

. On the right, click *Order*.

. On the resulting screen, select `tag_db.csv` in the *Filename* field and click *Submit*.

. Monitor `automation.log` on the `cf` server.  When the process is complete, continue with the next section.
It can be done by establishing an SSH connection to the CloudForms server and watching the content of `automation.log`:
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudFomrm web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.
+
[TIP]
The csv files for attributes can be accessed in the machine `cf` under the folder `/mnt/migrate/import_csv/tags/`.

=== Check Tags and Attributes

. Go to *Infrastructure -> Providers -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs*.

. Navigate to the `db` VM.

. Under *Custom Attributes*, confirm that there is a custom attribute called `ip` with the value you provided in `attribute_db.csv`.

. Under *Smart Management*, confirm that *migrate_group* is set to `demo2` and *Point of Arrival* is set to `Rhev`.

=== Start VM Pre-Migration

. On the `cf` system, go to *Services -> Catalogs* and choose the *Service Catalogs* pane.

. Under *All Services -> Migration*, select *Batch_PreMigrate*.

. On the right, click *Order*.

. For *Migration Group*, select `demo2`.

. Verify in the *VMs in Migration Group* textbox that `db` is the only Vm displayed, and click *Submit*.

. Monitor `automation.log` in the terminal connected to CloudForms.
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudFomrm web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.

=== Start VM Migration

. On the `cf` system, go to *Services -> Catalogs* and choose the *Service Catalogs* pane.

. Under *All Services -> Migration*, select *Batch_Migrate*.

. On the right, click *Order*.

. For *Migration Group*, select `demo2`.

. Verify in the *VMs in Migration Group* textbox that `db` is the only Vm displayed, and click *Submit*.

. Monitor `automation.log` in the terminal connected to CloudForms, and the Red Hat Virtualization Admin GUI closely.
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be seen in the CloudFomrm web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.
+
[TIP]
====
It may be beneficial to open three separate sessions to the Migration server and run the following:

----
# watch find /mnt
----

----
# tail -f /mnt/migrate/ova/db.example.com/*log
----

----
# tail -f /mnt/migrate/ova/db.example.com/*err
----
====
+
NOTE: It takes about 20 minutes for `automation.log` to show that the service is complete.

=== Verify VM Migration

. Log in to the Red Hat Virtualization Admin GUI and open the console for the `db` VM that was migrated.

. Start the `db` VM and log in as `root` with the password `<to_be_provided>`.

. Make sure the VM retained the IP address from `attribute_db.csv` and that it can resolve an external hostname.


== Migrate the JBoss EAP VMs from VMware to RHV Platform

. Use CloudForms to shut down (_not_ power off) the VMs to be migrated. Initially just `jboss0` and `jboss1` but, all VMs can be shut down (`db`, `jboss0`, `jboss1`, `lb`).
+
[TIP]
It can be verified that `jboss0` and `jboss1` VM are down by running, in the terminal, in the workstation machine, the check command:
`# ansible jboss -m ping`

For all application VMs (`db`, `jboss0`, `jboss1`, `lb`) the check command is:
`# ansible app -m ping`

=== Set VM Migration Attributes

. On the `cf` system, go to *Services -> Catalogs* and select the *Service Catalogs* pane.

. Under *All Services -> Import CSV*, select *Import Attributes*.

. On the right, click *Order*.

. On the resulting screen, enter `attribute_jboss.csv` in the *Filename* field and click *Submit*.

. Monitor `automation.log` on the `cf` server.  When the process is complete, continue with the next section.
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be seen in the CloudFomrm web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.

=== Set VM Migration Tags

. On the `cf` system, go to *Services -> Catalogs -> Service Catalogs*.

. Under *All Services -> Import CSV*, select *Import Tags*.

. On the right, click *Order*.

. On the resulting screen, enter `tag_jboss.csv` in the *Filename* field and click *Submit*.

. Monitor `automation.log` on the `cf` server.  When the process is complete, continue with the next section.

=== Check Tags and Attributes

. Go to *Infrastructure -> Providers -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs*.

=== Migrate the VM

. On the `cf` system, go to *Services -> Catalogs -> Service Catalogs*.

. Under *All Services -> Migration*, select *Batch_Migrate*.

. On the right, click *Order*.

. For *Migration Group*, select `demo` then click *Submit*.

. Monitor `automation.log` and the RHV Platform dashboard closely.

== End State

* You now have the `db` server on VMware and the two `jboss` servers on RHV Platform.  
* The `lb` system remains on VMware

== Extra Credit

* Use what you learned in this lab to migrate `lb` to RHV Platform (Tip: use `demo3` migration group)

== Extra Tip

* You can use `attribute_all.csv` for attributes, `tag_all.csv` for tags, and `fulltest` as migration group, to perform a full migration.
