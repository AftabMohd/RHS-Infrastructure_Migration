== Red Hat Solutions: IT Optimization - Infrastructure Migration v2 Deployment

:numbered:

== Overview

The field experience in migrating VMs from propietary virtualization infrastructures to oven virtualization infrastructures has been consolidaest in several real life customized engagements. From the experience of these engagements and with the involvement of Engineering and User Experience and Design teams a productized version of it is being built.

This document intends to provide the information needed to perform a successful deployment of the Infrastructure Migration solution

== Requirements

What is needed torun the solutiona nd, hopefully, why ... :-)

=== Product requirements

The minimum product versions required to run the solution are the following:
[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Product |Version
|CloudForms |4.6 beta
|Red Hat Virtualization |4.2.2 beta
|Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Hypervisor) |7.5 beta
|VMware vSphere |5.5
|=======

=== CloudForms requirements

CloudForms is the product built from the code of its upstream project ManageIQ. There will be references to ManageIQ as the place where the changes are performed to get them into the product. 

Initially Cloudforms will be deployed using the following appliance:
TODO: Add appliance URL

To save time a pre-deployed appliance is provided

The CloudForms appliance will use

* RHEL 7.4 
* Software Collections 
** PostgreSQL 9.5

The recommended deployment shall include three disks:

** Disk1: Operating System and CloudForms 
** Disk2: PostgreSQL database
** Disk3: Logs

=== RHV Requirements

Red Hat Virtualization, referred as RHV, is the product built from the code of its upstream project oVirt. 
To be able to performt he migration the following versions are required:

* RHEL 7.5 beta
* RHV 4.2.2 beta

The code being included will reach the product once it's published as GA.

Meanwhile, the location of the packages used in this lab are the following:
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Product |Origin| Use
|RHEL 7.5 |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-RHEL-7.5/compose/Server/$basearch/os/ |RHEL 7.5.z beta builds (Libvirt changes needed)
|RHEL 7.5 optional |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-RHEL-7.5/compose/Server-optional/$basearch/os/ | RHEL 7.5 optional packages beta builds
|RHEL 7.5 extras |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/latest-EXTRAS-7-RHEL-7.5/compose/Server/$basearch/os/ | RHEL 7.5 extras packages beta builds
|RHV Hypervisor packages for RHEL 7.5 |http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/repos/rhevh-rhel-7.5-candidate/$basearch/ |RHV Hypervisor beta builds for RHEL 7.5
|RHV Manager 4.2.2 |http://bob.eng.lab.tlv.redhat.com/builds/4.2/rhv-4.2.2-3/el$releasever |RHV Manager 4.2.2 beta builds
|JBoss EAP 7.1 |http://download.devel.redhat.com/devel/candidates/JBEAP/composing/latest-JBEAP-7.1-RHEL-7/compose/Server/$basearch/os/ |RHV Manager depends on it
|=======

The packages are already available "offline" in the environment in:

* http://storage.example.com/repos

The following link::https://github.com/RedHatDemos/RHS-Optimize_IT-Infrastructure_Migration/blob/master/notes_v2/rhv_infra_migration.repo[repo file] is used to consume the packages in the environment for the Manager, as well as for the Hypervisors, which are RHEL based.

=== Conversion Host Requirements

To perform the conversion task of the VMs during migration a conversion host is required. One of the architectural choices is to use RHEL-H Hypervisors as conversion hosts, which is the one we will use here.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Product |Origin| Use
|VDDK SDK |http://storage.example.com/repos/VMware-vix-disklib-6.5.2-6195444.x86_64.tar.gz |Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK)
|VDDK RPMs |http://storage.example.com/repos/v2v-nbdkit-rpms |Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) RPMs
|VDDK SRPMs |http://storage.example.com/repos/v2v-nbdkit-src-rpms |Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) SRPMs
|=======

== VM Migration Workflow

image::migration_workflow.png[VM Migration Workflow]

. The Infrastructure Admin creates an *Infrastructure Mapping* and *Migration Plan* for VM migration. The VM migration executes.

. CloudForms locates the *VMs* chosen to migrate based on the *Infrastructure Mapping* and source *ESXi hosts*.  

. The ESXi host *fingerprint* is captured for VM conversion. 

. Using the *RHV attributes* for the target environment, CloudForms initiates communication with the *RHV engine* and *API upload*.

. The *RHV API upload* selects a *conversion host* for the VM transformation. RHEL based RHV hosts must have the tools installed, and configured as *conversion hosts*.

. The *RHV conversion host* captures the *VM attributes* from the source using virt-v2v.

. The *target VM* is created.

. The *RHV conversion host* connects to the source *VM datastore* and streams the disk conversion to the *RHV data domain* (a.k.a. Storage Domain). A disk with the transformed VM is created.

. Once the disk creation is complete, the *disk is attached* to the *target VM*.

. *VM migration is complete* and status displayed in CloudForms.

For more detail plese take a look at the link:images/migration_workflow_vm_conversion_rhv.png[full detailed vm migration and conversion workflow] 

== Deployment

=== CloudForms Deployment

The deployed instance is a ManageIQ nightly build.

Go to http://www.jung-christian.de/post/2017/11/continuous-integration-with-automate/

Import https://github.com/fdupont-redhat/v2v-automate

TODO: playbook to un-configure
TODO: Add providers 

=== Conversion Host Installation

We will use both hypervisors, `kvm0` and `kvm1`, as conversion hosts

In the `root` folder of the Worksation, used as *Ansible* main host, the following repo is cloned:
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|=======
|Folder |Origin| Use
|manageiq |https://github.com/fdupont-redhat/v2v-transformation_host-ansible.git |Main ManageIQ backend code (CloudForms Upstream)
|=======

The file `inventory.yml` is created, in the `v2v-transformation_host-ansible` folder, with the following content:

----
all:
  vars:
    v2v_repo_rpms_name: "v2v-nbdkit-rpms"
    v2v_repo_rpms_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/v2v-nbdkit-rpms"
    v2v_repo_srpms_name: "v2v-nbdkit-src-rpms"
    v2v_repo_srpms_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/v2v-nbdkit-src-rpms"
    v2v_vddk_package_name: "VMware-vix-disklib-6.5.2-6195444.x86_64.tar.gz"
    v2v_vddk_package_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/VMware-vix-disklib-6.5.2-6195444.x86_64.tar.gz"
  hosts:
    kvm0.example.com:
    kvm1.example.com:
----

Then the playbooks are run. To check:

----
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory.yml transformation_host_check.yml 
----

After that, and if it all went OK, the installation:

----
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory.yml transformation_host_enable.yml 
----
