== Red Hat Solutions: IT Optimization - Infrastructure Migration - Lab

:numbered:

== Overview

*Work in Progress*

This lab uses Red Hat CloudForms, and the Infrastructure Migration plugin as a broker to migrate VMs from VMware vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization. 
 
The initial steps consist in assigning the infrastructure providers to be used as point of departure and point of arrival for the VMs. In this case the providers will be:

* VMware vSphere
* Red Hat Virtualization

After this initial step, the resource equivalence between the two providers has to be defined in an *Infrastucture Mapping* including:

* Clusters
* Storage Domains
* Networks

To perform the migration a minimum of one *Conversion Host* has to be configured. In this case we will use the RHEL hypervisors as conversion hosts.

Finally, a *Migration Plan* has to be executed to perform the final migration.

.Goal
* Migrate several VMs from vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization with a Red Hat Solution: Infrastructure Migration
+
NOTE: The source VM's are still maintained post migration and are not deleted. This allows for "failback" if a migration failure occurs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* It takes about 20 ~ 30 minutes for the demo to load completely and become accessible.
** Wait for the full demo to load, even if some of its systems are marked "Up."
* Watch for an email with information about how to access your demo environment.
** Make note of the email's contents: a list of hostnames, IP addresses, and your GUID.
** Whenever you see <YOUR-GUID> in the demo instructions, replace it with the GUID provided in the email.
* You can get real-time updates and status of your demo environment at https://www.opentlc.com/rhpds-status.
====
+
[TIP]
Be mindful of the runtime of your demo environment! It may take several hours to complete the demo, so you may need to extend the runtime. This is especially important in later steps when you are building virtual machines. For information on how to extend runtime and lifetime, see https://www.opentlc.com/lifecycle.

=== Environment

A full new demo environment is deployed on every request. To make the environment unique a 4 character identifier is assigned to it (i.e. `1e37`), this identifier is referred in this documentation as *GUID*.  

The demo environment consists of the following systems:

|=======

.Prerequisites

* Deployment of the demo environment which includes the following VMs provisioned in the vSphere environment:
** `jboss0` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `jboss1` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `lb` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running Nginx configured to proxy traffic to `jboss0` and `jboss1`
** `db` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running PostgreSQL that the `jboss0` and `jboss1` application servers connect to

* An external service is configured as https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com pointing to the Load Balancer to make the Ticket Monster app accesible.

== Getting Started

. Once the system is running, use SSH to access your demo server using your OPENTLC login name and private SSH key.

* Using a Unix/Linux system:
+
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key <YOUR-OpenTLC-USERNAME-redhat.com>@workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

* Example for user 'batman' and GUID '1e37', using the default ssh private key:
+
----
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa batman-redhat.com@workstation-1e37.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Become `root` using the provided password:
+
----
$ sudo -i
----

. Check the status of the environment using ansible:
+
----
# ansible all -m ping
----
+
This command establishes a connection to all the machines in the environment (except ESXi servers). 
In case the machines are up an running a success message, per each, will show up. 
This is an example of a success message for the VM jboss0.example.com:
+
----
jboss0.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
----
+ 
There are 4 VMs in the vCenter environment hosting an app with Nginx as loadbalancer, two JBoss EAP in domain mode, and a Postgresql database.
To check only if these ones are running, you may use the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----

. Establish an SSH connection to the CloudForms server and monitor `automation.log`:
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/log/manageiq/automation.log
----
+
[TIP]
The log entries are very long, so it helps if you stretch this window as wide as possible.
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudForms web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.

. Verify that the Ticket Monster app is running:

* Point your browser to https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com and check it is running:
+
image::app-ticketmonster-running.png[Ticket Monster app running]
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.
+
image::ssl_cert_warning.png[SSL Cert Warning]

. Prepare to manage the environment. From a web browser, open each of the URLs below in its own window or tab, using these credentials (except when noted):

* *Username*: `admin`
* *Password*: `<to_be_provided>`
+
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.

* *Red Hat Virtualization Manager:* `https://rhevm-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
.. Navigate to and click *Administration Portal* and log in using `admin`, `<to_be_provided>`, and `internal`.
+
image::rhv_login.png[RHV Login]

.. Verify that the Cluster is up and Hypervisors are active
+
[TIP]
As this is nested virtualization, sometimes the CPU type of the hypervisor is changed. 
+
image::rhv_hypervisors_up.png[RHV Hypervisors up]

* *vCenter:* `https://vcenter-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+
image::vsphere_web_client_1.png[vCenter Login]

.. Use `root` as the username to log in to vCenter.

.. Click *Log in to vSphere Web Client*.
+
image::vsphere_web_client_2.png[vCenter]

** Flash Player is required.
+
[TIP]
Modern browsers have flash player disabled by default. You may need to enable it for this page. Here are the link:01-redhat_solutions-insfrastructure_migration_v2-enable_flash.adoc[instructions to enable Adobe Flash]

.. Click *VMs and Templates* and verify that the 4 VMs `lb.example.com`, `jboss0.example.com`, `jboss0.example.com` and `db.example.com` are running. 


* *CloudForms:* `https://cf-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+

=== Validate the Current Infrastructure in CloudForms

. On the CloudForms web interface, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_1.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 1]

. If you see an exclamation mark (*!*), or a cross (*x*) in a provider, check the provider's box, go to *Authentication -> Re-check Authentication Status*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_2.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 2]
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_3.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 3]
+
[TIP]
Take into account that vCenter may take longer to start.

. Go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs*.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_1.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 1]

. All VMs, Orphaned VMs and Templates in both RHV and vSphere show as entities in CloudForms.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_2.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 2]
+
[NOTE]
If you needed to validate providers, you may have to wait a few minutes and refresh the screen before the VMs show up.

. Select the pane *VMs & Templates* and, in it, the *VMware* provider.

. Only the VMs and Templates in vSphere will show.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_3.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 3]

=== Check Conversion Hosts

. On the `cf` system, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+

. Select *Policy -> Edit Tags*.
+
image::conversion_host_3.png[Conversion Host 3]

. Check that *V2V - Transformation Host* has value *t* (for true) and that *V2V - Transformation Method* tag has value *VDDK*. Click *Cancel*.
+
image::conversion_host_6.png[Conversion Host 6]
+
* This values can also be seen in the *Smart Management* box in the host description
+
image::conversion_host_7.png[Conversion Host 7]

. Select *Configuration -> Edit this item* (back in `kvm0`).
+
image::conversion_host_8.png[Conversion Host 8]

. Check that *Username* has `root` and Password is set. You can click *Validate* to verify they are OK then the message "Credential validation was successful" will appear. This is needed to be able to connect to the conversion host and initiate the conversion.
+
image::conversion_host_9.png[Conversion Host 9]

. The conversion host is ready.


=== Create an Infrastructure Mapping

. Navigate to the *Compute -> Migration -> Ovewrview*.
+
[NOTE]
A login page may appear. Introduce the credentials used to login in CloudForms
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_1.png[Infrastructure Mapping 1]

. Click on *Create Infrastructure Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_2.png[Infrastructure Mapping 2]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, type a the name `ticket-monster-mapping` and click *next*.
+
* A description may be added to make it easy to, later on, recognice the usage of the mapping.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_3.png[Infrastructure Mapping 3]

.  In the *step 2* of the wizard, *Clusters*, select *Source Cluster* as `Cluster01` and *Target Cluster* as `Default` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_4.png[Infrastructure Mapping 4]

.  In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Datastores*, select *Source Datastore* as `Datastore` and *Target Datastore* as `vmstore00` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_5.png[Infrastructure Mapping 5]

.  In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Networks*, select *Source Network* as `VM Network` and *Target Network* as `ovirtmgmt` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_6.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]

.  In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, a message `All mappings in ticket-monster-mapping have been mapped.` shall appear. Click *close*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_7.png[Infrastructure Mapping 7]

In these steps an *Înfrastructure Mapping* has been created in order to simplify source and target resources using the data collected by Red hat CloudForms from both VMware vSphere and Red Hat Virtualization.

=== Create an Migration Plan

. Start in the CloudForms page accessed by navigating to *Compute -> Migration -> Ovewrview*, which is the finishing page from previous step.

. Click on *Create Migration Plan*.
+
image::migration_plan_1.png[Migration Plan 1]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, select the *Infrastructure Mapping* to be used, `ticket-monster-mapping`, add the name `ticket-monster-plan` and click *next*.
+
image::migration_plan_2.png[Migration Plan 2]
+
* A description may be added to make it easy to, later on, recognice the usage of the plan.

. In a different brower page, download the CSV file with the VMs link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatDemos/RHS-Optimize_IT-Infrastructure_Migration/master/notes/ticket_monster_migration.csv[ticket_monster_migration.csv]
+
image::migration_plan_3.png[Migration Plan 3]
+
[NOTE]
This step will be kept for massive migrations, however, a different interface to choose VMs to be migrated is expected in the near term
+
[TIP]
To get the VM ids for the CVS file the following commands can be run in CloudForms:
---- 
# cd /var/www/miq/vmdb
# bundle exec rails c
irb> Vm.find_by(:name => "<VM_NAME>").id
----

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *VMs*, select the *Browse* to select a CSV file with the names of the VMs to be migrated. Then selec `ticket_monster_migration.csv` and click *Open*.
+
image::migration_plan_4.png[Migration Plan 4]

. The list of the VMs to be migrated shall appear in on screen. Review and click *create*.
+
image::migration_plan_5.png[Migration Plan 5]

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Results*, the message `Migration Plan: ticket-monster-plan is in progress` shall appear. Click *close*.
+
image::migration_plan_6.png[Migration Plan 6]

. Now the migration is executing. We can see the orchestration process in Cloudforms logs
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/log/manageiq/automation.log
----
+
And each VM migration process in the Conversion Host:
+
----
# ssh kvm0.example.com
# tail -f /var/log/vdsm/import/*
----

. CloudForms inerface shows migration status too
+
image::migration_running_1.png[Migration Running 1]

. In RHV interface we can see starting to appear
+
image::migration_running_2.png[Migration Running 2]

. Migration finishes
+
image::migration_running_3.png[Migration Running 3]

. And we can see the app running
+
image::migration_running_5.png[Migration Running 5]
